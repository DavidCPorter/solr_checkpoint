# defaults file for solr

# VARIABLE PRECEDENCE
# If multiple variables of the same name are defined in different places, they win in a certain order, which is:
# extra vars (-e in the command line) always win
# then comes connection variables defined in inventory (ansible_ssh_user, etc)
# then comes "most everything else" (command line switches, vars in play, included vars, role vars, etc)
# then comes the rest of the variables defined in inventory
# then comes facts discovered about a system
# then "role defaults", which are the most "defaulty" and lose in priority to everything.
